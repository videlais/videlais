## Personal Projects

I maintain various tools, libraries, and historical collections related to authoring tools:

- [Quis](https://github.com/videlais/quis): Lightweight DSL for dynamic story sorting.
- [Twine Space](https://github.com/videlais/twine-space): A Twine 2 story format supporting locative and mixed reality projects.
- [Extwee](https://github.com/videlais/extwee): A story compilation tool supporting all past and present Twine-compatible formats.
- [Story Format Archive (SFA)](https://github.com/videlais/story-formats-archive): Collection of present and past story formats for Twine.

## Tutorial Collections

Based on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTWJzxNdsIDHiYzGh-2Fd1w), I archive public code examples across multiple tools.

## Documentation Contributions

I contributed significantly to Twine-related documentation projects while serving as part of the Twine Committee from 2017 to 2022. Beginning early 2023, I also occasionally consult or have helped with historical documentation efforts.
